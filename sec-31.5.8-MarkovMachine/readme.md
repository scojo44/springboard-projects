### Algorithmic Things

- [x] Start with a capitalized word
  - [x] Better still:  A word that starts a sentence
- [x] Stop at a period, question mark or exclamation point
  - [x] If maximum words reached, make sure the last word includes sentence-ending punctuation
- [x] Use bigrams (two words at a time) for a more realistic-looking result

### Node Practice Things

- [x] Find a library to strip the HTML when fetching a URL
- [x] Support multiple files and/or URLs
