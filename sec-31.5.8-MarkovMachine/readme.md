### Algorithmic Things

- [x] Start with a capitalized word
  - [ ] Better still:  A word that starts a sentence
- [ ] Stop at a period
  - [ ] If maximum words reached, use a word at the end of a sentence
- [x] Use bigrams (two words at a time) for a more realistic-looking result

- [ ] Find a library to strip the HTML when fetching a URL
- [x] Support multiple files and/or URLs
